          Personally I think we all have our virtues and strengths just as we
          also have our weaknesses, so the teamwork is important in order to
          mitigate those weaknesses and achieve goals more easily, also we all
          have an area in the which we are really good at. mine is to find
          various solutions and prevent future mistakes. I think I have good
          communication and I'm good at teaching.
